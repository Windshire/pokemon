	<h1>Pokemon Strength Rater</h1>
	
	<p>
		This webpage will be a tool for more accurately assessing the 
		battling strength of a Pokemon in Pokemon GO, because CP 
		absolutely sucks as an indicator.

		Right now, I'm just trying to get a basic idea of how to 
		program behavior into webpages. 
		Once I get closer to actually creating something useful, 
		then I will start to look at making the UI not look like trash. 
		But that is not a priority right now. I just want 
		to learn about functionality. The bullet points that appear 
		when clicking the "Get Result" button are just debugging stuff 
		that won't be on the actual page.
		<br><br>
		June 1 2017: On this first session, I was able to code 
		the algorithms used to compute attack damage. Since I focused 
		on this, I haven't looked into actually selecting specific 
		Pokemon and obtaining unique data for them. So every Pokemon 
		is a Vaporeon with 0% IVs and a Water Gun/Hydro Pump moveset. 
		The calculations, however, work correctly, and will continue 
		to work correctly once I begin to plug other types of Pokemon 
		and moves in.
